The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has placed increasing emphasis on high-quality labeled medical data, particularly in medical imaging modalities such as CT and MRI. However, the annotation process remains a significant bottleneck due to its heavy reliance on medical expertise, manual effort, and time, which limits scalability and consistency. To address these challenges, this thesis proposes the development of a smart annotation system tailored for medical imaging data, combining cutting-edge open-source tools with AI-assisted labeling to streamline annotation workflows.

Our system integrates advanced annotation platforms such as OHIF Viewer for intuitive DICOM visualization, MONAI Label for AI-driven interactive segmentation, and workflow management support inspired by Encord. Furthermore, we incorporate pretrained deep learning models and interactive labeling techniques to reduce manual workload while ensuring annotation precision. The solution is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing seamless management of labeling tasks, support for both 2D and 3D medical images, and the ability to dynamically incorporate AI predictions for faster decision-making.

This thesis focuses on creating a practical annotation tool that not only accelerates the data labeling process but also empowers healthcare professionals with a user-friendly interface to efficiently interact with complex medical data. Preliminary evaluation suggests a promising reduction in annotation time while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our system also lays the groundwork for future extensibility, enabling researchers to customize models and expand to various anatomical regions or clinical tasks.

By bridging the gap between AI capabilities and clinical requirements, this work contributes to the creation of high-quality medical datasets, fosters AI adoption in healthcare, and promotes more efficient and scalable medical data annotation practices.
