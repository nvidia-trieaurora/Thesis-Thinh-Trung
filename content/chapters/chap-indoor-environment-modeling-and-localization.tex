\label{sec:Indoor Environment Modeling and Localization}
\begin{ChapAbstract}
Chapter 2 addresses the core challenges of indoor environment modeling and localization, which are essential for augmented reality (AR) navigation systems. The chapter presents an approach to constructing accurate 3D models of indoor spaces using the Vuforia Creator application. These models are then imported as Area Targets into Unity, providing a precise framework for environment tracking. Advanced tracking techniques are discussed, including using mobile camera feeds, Area Target Observers, and runtime occlusion to ensure a seamless overlay of AR content. Furthermore, the chapter introduces a multi-faceted indoor positioning strategy that combines automated tracking for small area targets with enhanced methods such as location priors for larger spaces and QR code-based re-localization. Together, these methods form a comprehensive system that significantly improves the reliability and accuracy of indoor navigation.
