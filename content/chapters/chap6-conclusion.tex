While the research has achieved its primary objectives, several important limitations have been identified that provide context for the system's current capabilities and highlight areas requiring continued development.

\textbf{AI Model Performance Variability}
The system's effectiveness is inherently dependent on the performance of underlying AI models, which exhibits significant variation across different scenarios and use cases. AI assistance effectiveness varies considerably across different imaging modalities and clinical cases, with some anatomical structures and pathological conditions remaining particularly challenging for automated assistance. Complex or unusual cases may not benefit significantly from current AI capabilities, requiring manual annotation approaches that limit the efficiency gains possible in these scenarios. Model performance can also vary substantially when applied to imaging data from different institutions or equipment manufacturers, highlighting the need for robust adaptation mechanisms and comprehensive validation across diverse data sources.

\textbf{Implementation and Resource Requirements}
The system requires substantial computational and infrastructure resources that may limit deployment feasibility in some healthcare environments. Computational requirements for AI processing can be significant, particularly for complex segmentation tasks and real-time processing scenarios. The system's AI features require appropriate hardware configurations for optimal performance, including sufficient GPU resources and memory capacity. Reliable internet connectivity proves beneficial for cloud-based processing features, though this requirement may present challenges in some institutional settings. Regular system maintenance and updates require dedicated technical expertise, which may not be readily available in all healthcare institutions considering adoption.

\textbf{User Training and Adaptation}
Despite careful attention to creating an intuitive interface, the system requires comprehensive user training and adaptation periods that can impact adoption timelines. New users typically require several weeks to achieve full proficiency with advanced features, particularly those involving AI-assisted workflows and collaborative annotation scenarios. Resistance to workflow changes may limit adoption in some institutional environments where established practices are deeply embedded in daily operations. Different user groups demonstrate varying training needs and adaptation periods, with some requiring more extensive support than others. Ongoing training proves necessary to keep users current with system updates and new features, requiring sustained educational efforts from implementing institutions.

\textbf{Validation and Scope Constraints}
The research was conducted within specific operational and methodological constraints that necessarily limit the generalizability of findings and conclusions. Current evaluation has been limited to specific use cases and institutional contexts, which may not fully represent the diversity of potential deployment scenarios. User studies involved limited numbers of participants from specific geographical regions, potentially introducing regional or cultural biases in usage patterns and acceptance metrics. Long-term clinical outcomes and system reliability have not been extensively evaluated due to the research timeframe constraints, leaving questions about sustained performance and impact over extended periods. Integration with broader healthcare information systems requires additional development work that extends beyond the current research scope.
