\begin{ChapAbstract}
Chapter 4 details the design, implementation, and evaluation of an integrated AI assistant for smart navigation. This chapter presents a comprehensive system architecture that unifies multiple components: a data generation module, a cloud-based Firebase database with a hierarchical data structure, and an AI assistant powered by a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) for natural language processing. It further explains the development of AI navigation capabilities using the Vuforia Engine and Creator App to enable real-time augmented reality experiences. The chapter also describes the user interface design—including an interactive home screen, AR navigation overlays, and a dedicated Q\&A metadata generation application—ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. A detailed demo plan is provided to illustrate the system's performance in diverse indoor environments.
