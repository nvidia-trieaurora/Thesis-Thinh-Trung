    \item \textit{Transaction Management:} Workflow state transitions implemented as database transactions to maintain consistency
    \item \textit{Audit Logging:} Basic logging of workflow operations for tracking and analysis purposes
    \item \textit{Metadata Storage:} PostgreSQL JSON columns for storing flexible workflow configuration and annotation data
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Workflow Engine Implementation:} The workflow engine implements a state machine approach using PostgreSQL stored procedures. The system manages workflow stage transitions by retrieving current workflow states and applying predefined rules to determine valid next stages. This implementation supports basic workflow progression and conditional branching based on user actions.

\textbf{Notification System:} The notification system uses Supabase real-time subscriptions to provide updates to connected clients when workflow events occur, enabling timely notifications about task assignments and status changes.
