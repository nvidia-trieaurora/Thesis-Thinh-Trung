\section{Frontend Design}
The frontend is meticulously designed to provide an intuitive, efficient, and highly responsive user experience for managing projects, building workflows, and performing precise medical image annotation.
\subsection{Frontend Application Framework: React \& Refine.dev}
The frontend's foundation is built upon React, a widely adopted JavaScript library celebrated for its component-based architecture. This paradigm promotes the development of reusable, self-contained UI units, which significantly enhances modularity, maintainability, and scalability of the application. React's declarative nature simplifies UI development, allowing complex interfaces to be efficiently composed from smaller, independent components. 

Building upon this robust React foundation, the platform extensively leverages Refine.dev, a headless frontend framework specifically engineered to accelerate the development of data-intensive applications such as admin panels and dashboards.

\subsubsection*{Problem Refine.dev Solves}
Traditional frontend development for data-intensive applications often faces several challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Boilerplate Code}: Implementing common enterprise features like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, authentication, routing, and state management typically involves writing a significant amount of repetitive boilerplate code, which slows down development and increases maintenance burden.
    \item \textbf{Compromise between Speed and Flexibility}: Developers often have to choose between low-code tools that offer rapid initial setup but lack long-term customizability and full-code approaches that provide flexibility but require extensive manual coding.
    \item \textbf{Complex State and API Management}: Handling API networking, complex state management, and robust authentication/authorization flows in data-heavy applications can be intricate and error-prone.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{How Refine.dev Solves It (Philosophy \& Features)}
Refine's philosophy centers on providing a "sweet spot between low-code and full-code," offering comparable initial development speed to drag-and-drop tools while ensuring infinite scalability for long-term complexity. It addresses the aforementioned pain points through its core features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Headless Architecture \& Decoupled UI}: Refine is "headless," meaning it provides the underlying logic and functionality without imposing a specific UI framework or design system. This allows developers 100\% control over the user interface, enabling seamless integration with any UI kit (e.g., Ant Design) or custom design, without being constrained by Refine's features interfering with the UI structure. Each UI component is exposed directly, not wrapped in an encapsulation layer, providing maximum flexibility.
    \item \textbf{Boilerplate-Free Code \& No Configuration}: Refine aims to eliminate repetitive tasks and boilerplate code, making projects easier to understand and maintain. It boasts an easy setup, allowing projects to be started in less than a minute using its Command Line Interface (CLI) program, which contributes to faster development times.
    \item \textbf{Backend Agnostic}: A core tenet of Refine's philosophy is its compatibility with any custom backend, including GraphQL, REST APIs, and specific integrations like Supabase, Strapi, and Firebase. This backend agnosticism prevents vendor lock-in and provides developers with complete control over their project's backend choices and workflows.
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Feature Set}: Refine offers a complete suite of features essential for data-driven applications, including routing, networking, authentication, state management (leveraging React Query for caching and data handling), and internationalization (i18n). Its router-agnostic design allows integration with popular routing solutions like React Router and Next.js, providing automatic parameter detection and redirections.
    \item \textbf{Native TypeScript Core}: Refine is built with a native TypeScript core, enhancing code quality, maintainability, and developer experience by providing static type checking.
    \item \textbf{Built-in Support \& Community}: Refine provides built-in support for various services and boasts a strong open-source community with 31.6K+ stars on GitHub, 8K+ projects in production, and 32K+ active developers. This vibrant ecosystem ensures ongoing development, support, and a wealth of shared knowledge.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visual Workflow Orchestrator}
The platform integrates XYFlow to create a sophisticated visual, graph-based interface for composing annotation pipelines. XYFlow is a powerful library for building interactive node-based editors, providing the core engine for managing node states, complex edge routing, and automatic layouts. This visual builder empowers users, particularly project managers and researchers, to intuitively design and modify complex, multi-stage annotation workflows using a drag-and-drop interface. Custom nodes are developed to represent specific medical-imaging workflow stages, such as "Data Ingestion (Orthanc)," "MITL Node," "Human Annotator Node" and "Human Review Node" These nodes abstract the underlying technical complexities, allowing users to focus on the logical flow of the annotation process. The visual representation aids in understanding data flow, identifying bottlenecks, and making real-time adjustments, thereby enhancing overall efficiency and adaptability.

\subsection{Integrated Medical Imaging Annotation Environment}
The primary annotation interface is built around the direct embedding of the OHIF Viewer within the platform's main React application, creating a unified and high-performance environment for medical image annotation.
\subsubsection*{OHIF Viewer v3: Philosophy, Architecture, and Evolution}
The OHIF Viewer is an open-source, web-based medical imaging platform designed to provide a core framework for building complex imaging applications with user-friendly interfaces. Its philosophy centers on being highly configurable and extensible, allowing it to load images from various sources (including DICOMweb) and render them in 2D, 3D, or restructured representations. The viewer aims to load large radiology studies as quickly as possible by retrieving metadata ahead of time and streaming pixel data as needed.Historically, medical imaging software often comprised desktop applications that were challenging to debug remotely and maintain by IT staff. The OHIF Viewer emerged in this context as an attractive web-based solution, leveraging cloud computing principles.
\subsubsection*{OHIF Viewer v2 Architecture and Challenges}
In its earlier iterations (e.g., v2), OHIF Viewer was built with React using reusable UI components, but its architecture presented challenges, particularly with extensions being hard to maintain. Creating new workflows often required building new UI components and extensions from scratch, which could be cumbersome. The direct embedding via a <script> tag, while possible, was deprecated in version 3, indicating a shift towards a more integrated and robust embedding strategy.
\subsubsection*{OHIF Viewer v3: Modernized Architecture and Solutions:}
OHIF Viewer v3 represents a significant re-architecture, transitioning to a modernized structure with TypeScript and ES module support. This transition enhances stability, accelerates development cycles, and improves accessibility. Key architectural components in v3 include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Core Libraries}: Implement medical imaging functions (business logic) for the web. UI Component Library (@ohif/ui-next): Built using shadcn/ui, providing a modern, compact layout for panels (e.g., Study Browser, Measurement, Segmentation) and offering enhanced theming and customization options.
    \item \textbf{Extensions}: Libraries implementing essential functionalities like rendering and measurement tracking. These are the building blocks consumed by modes.
    \item \textbf{Modes}: A pivotal new concept in v3. Modes are configuration objects that compose extensions and routes to create specific application workflows or "mini-apps" within a single viewer. This allows users to utilize common extensions with different configurations, significantly enhancing customizability and eliminating the need to duplicate viewer codebase for new workflows.
    \item \textbf{Cornerstone3D}: The underlying rendering and tooling library, providing a more robust and stable foundation for 3D rendering and annotations, and supporting features like GPU acceleration and multi-threading for quick image decoding.
    \item \textbf{Performance Optimizations}: V3 leverages React 18 for concurrent rendering, offers automatic preloading of the next series to reduce loading times, and integrates Web Worker Manager to offload intensive tasks without impacting UI performance.
\end{itemize}
This modular and extensible framework allows users to focus on their specific use cases without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, providing significant benefits for custom project adjustments. Users can customize the viewer for their specific workflows and add new functionalities without forking the entire codebase. This flexibility is crucial for researchers and developers who need to adapt the viewer to unique project requirements or integrate it with proprietary systems.
\subsubsection*{Integration with MONAI Label Interface for AI-Assisted Labeling}
The platform facilitates a seamless integration of the MONAI Label interface directly into the OHIF Viewer, enabling powerful AI-assisted annotation workflows. This integration is a result of a partnership between OHIF and NVIDIA to migrate the MONAI Label plugin to the OHIF Viewer v3 platform.
\subsubsection*{MONAI Label Integration and Interaction:}
This integration allows users to effortlessly connect their MONAI Label server to OHIF Viewer v3, leveraging a wide range of advanced AI features. MONAI Label, as an intelligent image labeling and learning tool, combines AI assistance with clinical expertise to deliver fast, accurate, and consistent annotations.The interaction flow is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
