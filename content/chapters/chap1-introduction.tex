\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Problem Overview}

In Vietnamese healthcare institutions, medical imaging data annotation represents a significant operational challenge that hinders the advancement of AI-assisted diagnostic capabilities. Major hospitals and medical centers across Vietnam generate thousands of CT and MRI studies monthly, yet lack efficient systems for creating the high-quality labeled datasets necessary for developing and deploying AI diagnostic tools.

Current annotation practices in Vietnamese healthcare settings rely on manual processes where radiologists and medical imaging specialists spend 2-4 hours per complex case, annotating anatomical structures and pathological findings slice by slice. This approach creates several critical bottlenecks: first, the limited pool of qualified medical imaging specialists in Vietnam results in annotation backlogs that can extend for months; second, inconsistency between different annotators leads to variable dataset quality that affects AI model reliability; third, the absence of collaborative tools means that complex cases cannot benefit from multi-expert consensus, reducing diagnostic confidence.

The fragmented nature of existing annotation tools exacerbates these challenges. Medical professionals typically use separate applications for image viewing (such as basic DICOM viewers), annotation (often basic drawing tools), and data management (manual file organization), requiring constant context switching that reduces efficiency and increases error potential. Additionally, most available annotation tools lack integration with AI assistance, forcing medical experts to perform entirely manual annotation even for routine structures that could be automatically detected.

Vietnamese healthcare infrastructure presents unique constraints that compound these annotation challenges. Many institutions operate with limited IT budgets and varying levels of technical expertise, necessitating solutions that are both cost-effective and easy to deploy. Furthermore, the need to accommodate Vietnamese medical terminology and local clinical practices requires customizable systems that can adapt to institutional workflows rather than imposing rigid, standardized processes.

The absence of intelligent annotation systems specifically designed for Vietnamese healthcare contexts represents a critical gap that limits the potential for AI adoption in medical imaging. Without efficient annotation capabilities, Vietnamese healthcare institutions cannot build the comprehensive labeled datasets required for developing AI diagnostic tools tailored to local patient populations and clinical scenarios.

\section{Research Motivation}

\subsection{Limitations of Current Manual Annotation Processes}

The traditional approach to medical data annotation involves highly trained medical professionals manually reviewing and labeling medical images. This process, while ensuring high accuracy, suffers from several critical limitations:

\textbf{Time Consumption and Resource Intensity:} Manual annotation of medical images is an extremely time-consuming process. A single CT scan containing hundreds of slices may require several hours of expert annotation time, making it impractical to scale for large datasets required by modern AI systems.

\textbf{Inter-annotator Variability:} Different medical experts may interpret and label the same anatomical structures or pathological findings differently, leading to inconsistencies in the resulting datasets. This variability can negatively impact the performance and reliability of AI models trained on such data.

\textbf{Cost and Availability of Expertise:} Medical imaging annotation requires specialized knowledge that is expensive and often scarce. The limited availability of qualified medical professionals creates bottlenecks in data preparation pipelines.

\textbf{Fatigue and Human Error:} Extended annotation sessions can lead to fatigue-induced errors, particularly when dealing with complex 3D medical images that require sustained attention and precision.

\subsection{Need for Intelligent Support Systems}

The limitations of manual annotation processes have created an urgent need for intelligent support systems that can:

\textbf{Accelerate Annotation Workflows:} By providing AI-assisted suggestions and automated preliminary annotations, intelligent systems can significantly reduce the time required for expert review and validation.

\textbf{Enhance Consistency:} Standardized AI assistance can help reduce inter-annotator variability by providing consistent baseline annotations that experts can refine and validate.

\textbf{Scale Annotation Capacity:} Intelligent systems can enable smaller teams of medical experts to handle larger volumes of data by automating routine aspects of the annotation process.

\textbf{Reduce Cognitive Load:} By handling repetitive or straightforward annotation tasks, AI assistance can allow medical experts to focus on complex cases requiring specialized knowledge and judgment.

\subsection{Vietnamese Healthcare Context and Practical Requirements}

The Vietnamese healthcare system presents unique requirements and constraints that must be addressed in developing annotation support systems:

\textbf{Resource Optimization:} Healthcare institutions in Vietnam often operate with limited budgets and technical resources, necessitating cost-effective solutions that maximize value and efficiency.

\textbf{Integration with Existing Systems:} Any annotation system must be compatible with existing medical imaging infrastructure and workflows commonly found in Vietnamese hospitals and clinics.

\textbf{Local Adaptation:} The system must accommodate Vietnamese medical terminology, local clinical practices, and regulatory requirements specific to the Vietnamese healthcare environment.

\textbf{Training and Adoption:} Solutions must be designed with user-friendly interfaces that facilitate adoption by medical professionals with varying levels of technical expertise.
