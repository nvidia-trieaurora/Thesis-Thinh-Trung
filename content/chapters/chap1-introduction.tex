\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Problem Overview}

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized numerous sectors, with healthcare emerging as one of the most promising domains for transformative applications. In medical imaging, AI technologies have demonstrated remarkable potential in diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care optimization. However, the success of AI systems in healthcare fundamentally depends on the availability of high-quality, accurately labeled medical data.

Medical imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and other DICOM-compliant formats generate vast amounts of complex data daily. The process of annotating this data—identifying and labeling anatomical structures, pathological conditions, and regions of interest—remains a critical bottleneck in the development of robust AI systems for healthcare applications.

The current medical data annotation process presents significant challenges that limit the scalability and effectiveness of AI deployment in clinical settings. Traditional annotation workflows rely heavily on manual intervention from medical experts, creating dependencies that are difficult to scale and maintain consistently across large datasets.

In the Vietnamese healthcare context, these challenges are particularly pronounced due to resource constraints, varying levels of technical infrastructure, and the need for solutions that can adapt to local medical practices and terminology. The development of an intelligent annotation system tailored for medical imaging data represents a crucial step toward addressing these limitations and enabling more widespread adoption of AI technologies in Vietnamese healthcare institutions.

\section{Research Motivation}

\subsection{Limitations of Current Manual Annotation Processes}

The traditional approach to medical data annotation involves highly trained medical professionals manually reviewing and labeling medical images. This process, while ensuring high accuracy, suffers from several critical limitations:

\textbf{Time Consumption and Resource Intensity:} Manual annotation of medical images is an extremely time-consuming process. A single CT scan containing hundreds of slices may require several hours of expert annotation time, making it impractical to scale for large datasets required by modern AI systems.

\textbf{Inter-annotator Variability:} Different medical experts may interpret and label the same anatomical structures or pathological findings differently, leading to inconsistencies in the resulting datasets. This variability can negatively impact the performance and reliability of AI models trained on such data.

\textbf{Cost and Availability of Expertise:} Medical imaging annotation requires specialized knowledge that is expensive and often scarce. The limited availability of qualified medical professionals creates bottlenecks in data preparation pipelines.

\textbf{Fatigue and Human Error:} Extended annotation sessions can lead to fatigue-induced errors, particularly when dealing with complex 3D medical images that require sustained attention and precision.

\subsection{Need for Intelligent Support Systems}

The limitations of manual annotation processes have created an urgent need for intelligent support systems that can:

\textbf{Accelerate Annotation Workflows:} By providing AI-assisted suggestions and automated preliminary annotations, intelligent systems can significantly reduce the time required for expert review and validation.

\textbf{Enhance Consistency:} Standardized AI assistance can help reduce inter-annotator variability by providing consistent baseline annotations that experts can refine and validate.

\textbf{Scale Annotation Capacity:} Intelligent systems can enable smaller teams of medical experts to handle larger volumes of data by automating routine aspects of the annotation process.

\textbf{Reduce Cognitive Load:} By handling repetitive or straightforward annotation tasks, AI assistance can allow medical experts to focus on complex cases requiring specialized knowledge and judgment.

\subsection{Vietnamese Healthcare Context and Practical Requirements}

The Vietnamese healthcare system presents unique requirements and constraints that must be addressed in developing annotation support systems:

\textbf{Resource Optimization:} Healthcare institutions in Vietnam often operate with limited budgets and technical resources, necessitating cost-effective solutions that maximize value and efficiency.

\textbf{Integration with Existing Systems:} Any annotation system must be compatible with existing medical imaging infrastructure and workflows commonly found in Vietnamese hospitals and clinics.

\textbf{Local Adaptation:} The system must accommodate Vietnamese medical terminology, local clinical practices, and regulatory requirements specific to the Vietnamese healthcare environment.

\textbf{Training and Adoption:} Solutions must be designed with user-friendly interfaces that facilitate adoption by medical professionals with varying levels of technical expertise.
