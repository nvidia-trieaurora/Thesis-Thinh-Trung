\begin{ChapAbstract}
Chapter 1 introduces the critical role of high-quality annotated data in modern machine learning and identifies the significant limitations of existing data annotation platforms, particularly their rigid workflows, insufficient auditability, and inflexible access control. It motivates the need for a novel platform designed to be flexible, auditable, and scalable, capable of supporting complex, real-world annotation pipelines. The chapter outlines the thesis objectives: to design and implement a platform with a dynamic, graph-based workflow engine, a fine-grained Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) system, and comprehensive audit trails. It highlights the benefits of these architectural components, emphasizing the platform's extensibility through its integration with specialized tools like OHIF Viewer, MONAI Label, and Orthanc for domains such as medical imaging. This introduction sets the stage for the detailed system design, implementation, and evaluation presented in the subsequent chapters.
